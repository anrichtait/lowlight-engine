        **FreeImage**
        3.19.0

# Upgrading 3.18.0

1. Copied all files from freeimage zip to G3D
2. Deleted any new/existing visual studio project files to avoid confusion
3. Added any new files to freeimage.lib project
4. I re-organized a couple file filters so I could see which files from subdirectories were added in OpenEXR and LibRawLite.
5. Updated some header paths in the freeimage.lib project for LibJPEG and LibOpenJPEG and new LibWebP.
6. Set USE_JPIP define in freeimage.lib project for LibOpenJPEG which added it to wrap some includes.
7. I changed the namespace used for Imf:staticInitialize() in Image.cpp to the internal namespace.
8. Patch header file paths as needed to match G3D current configuration
9. Force `#define FREEIMAGE_COLORORDER FREEIMAGE_COLORORDER_RGB` in FreeImage.h regardless of endianness

# Upgrading 3.19.0

1. Updated all freeimage files while keeping modifications specific to G3D
2. Left out Visual Studio files
3. Left out LibRawLite and LibJXR
