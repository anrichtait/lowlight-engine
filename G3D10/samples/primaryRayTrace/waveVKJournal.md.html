2023-03-16: waveVK.lib handoff
=============================================================
Sponza now works in Release mode.
Other scenes have some missing geometry, I think because of a dependence on texture in the Universal Material.

Limitations:
- Only works with UniversalMaterial with a texture (not a G3D created readMultiplyFirst texture) in the material slots. Not all slots need to be populated.
- No dynamic scene updates.

Replace line 131 of main.cpp in primaryRayTrace with:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
scene()->tritree(Scene::TriTreeGPUAPI::VULKAN)->intersectRays(m_rayOriginTexture, m_rayDirectionTexture, m_gbuffer);
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

to run with the VulkanTriTree backend. 
I also recommend setting a dependency between primaryRayTrace and waveVK.lib when debugging so waveVK.lib rebuilds automatically.



2023-02-28: waveVK.lib handoff
=============================================================
Previous dependencies have been removed. Everything needed should be in G3D.

VulkanTriTree can be selected by passing `true` when querying the scene for the tritree
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
scene()->tritree(true)->intersectRays(m_rayOriginTexture, m_rayDirectionTexture, m_gbuffer);
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Currently throwing on the call to `vkCreateRayTracingPipelinesNV`.

This horrible bug was caused by the codesize passed during shader creation getting the size in unsigned ints but
expecting the size in bytes. Caught by the enabled validation layer.



2021-08-08: Build instructions for based.lib and base.lib
=============================================================
Clone this repository: https://github.com/ZanderMajercik/Vulkan
Build it using CMake in the root directory. This can be done with cmake GUI:
- Navigate to the root dir in CMAKE GUI
- create a build dir
- configure, configure again, followed by generating (after selecting the correct VS build tools).
- The "base" project file should automatically link against G3D GL. If you would like to link against a different GL checkout, change the include directory in the "base" project file.
- Build base in debug (based.lib) and release mode (base.lib)


2020-09-18: Feature parity wave.lib TODO
=============================================================
[ ] Fix material bug in Cornell Box related to texture bias and scale. There are constant color textures created on the fly in G3D that
    are just a scale and bias. These textures are not rendering correctly in waveVk.lib.
[ ] Implement updating transforms in the TLAS.
[ ] Implement creating and removing objects in the TLAS.
[ ] waveVK.lib produces same images as wave.lib with dynamic geometry and lights.
[ ] Implement geometry caching after wave.lib
[ ] Implement material caching after wave.lib.
[ ] waveVK.lib produces same image as wave.lib and has the same C++ optimizations.

Cleanup:
[ ] Separate shared resource vector from named resources. Keep it only for correctly destroying resources.

2020-03-24: Feature parity wave.lib TODO
=============================================================

Goal is feature parity by 4/3.

[x] Implement alpha testing with an anyhit shader.
[x] waveVK.lib produces same image as primaryRayTrace for a static scene

2020-03-19: Material Plan
=============================================================

struct Material {

int texNSampler;
int tex0Sampler;
int tex1Sampler;
int tex2Sampler;
int tex3Sampler;

};

- VulkanTriTree::createMaterial():
 + build out resource request API and make existing code use it.
 + use resource request API to create Texture with Vulkan memory backing
 + Use OptiXTriTree caching scheme to ensure textures are only copied once
  - TODO
 + Use wave.lib caching scheme to store material indices for each instance.

2020-01-08: Task List with Timings
=============================================================

For feature parity with wave.lib:
[ ] Geometry
    [x] Passed in transforms on surfaces from G3D are wrong when converted to GLM matrices (2 hours)
    [x] All geometry is on the same BLAS. (4 hours)
    [ ] Port geometry caching from wave.lib to waveVK.lib (2 hours)
    [ ] Update VulkanTriTree::setContents() to take advantage of geometry caching in waveVK.lib (1 hour)
    [ ] Best practices for geometry and (B|T)LAS creation in VKRT (4 hours)
[ ] Materials
    [x] Figure out how to bind multiple materials in VKRT. (6 hours)
    [x] Create materials for each surface in waveVK.lib as in wave.lib. (6 hours)
    [ ] Port material caching from wave.lib. (2 hours)
    [ ] Vulkan has to own the memory for interop, so can't share textures that were loaded in GL.
        Could return the texture id and the barycentrics to VulkanTriTree and run a pass to sample
        the material in GL. (8 hours)
    [ ] Alternately, could push interop into G3D and create vulkan textures for programs that use waveVK.lib. (16 hours)
        [ ] What are the necessary objects (VkTexture, VkBuffer, VkSampler etc.) for G3D Texture functionality?
[ ] GLSL Hot Shader Compilation from G3D (3 hours)
[x] Variable buffer size/window resolution. (4 hours)

Total time until feature parity: ~64 hours

For clean integration into G3D:
[ ] Decide on API Dependencies:
    [ ] Vulkan C++ API or C API? (2 hours)
    [ ] Remove dependency on github vulkan helpers. Dependency was for expediency when implementing interop. (4 hours)
        [ ] Remove GLM dependency.
    [ ] Clean up and formally integrate NVIDIA VKRT helper functions (if they are a helpful abstraction). (4 hours)
[ ] Set up should mirror OpenGL: we provide the correct headers and the user links against vulkan. Ensure that
    the vulkan packaged with G3D satisfies this requirement. (4 hours)

Total time for clean G3D integration: ~16 hours

Total time for both: ~84 hours (2 full weeks)
