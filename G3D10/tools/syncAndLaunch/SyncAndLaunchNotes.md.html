# Windows to Windows Workflow
## Set Environment Variables
1. On your local machine, set a variable `G3D10_REMOTE_MACHINE` to be the account and address of your remote machine (e.g. `user@HQ-XXXXXXX.network.local`)
2. On your local machine, set a variable `G3D10_SERVICE_DISOVERY` to be the address of the computer running matchmaker with a specified port (e.g. if running matchermaker on local machine: `localhost:6175`, else `HQ-YYYYYYY.network.local:6175`)
3. On your remote machine, set a variable `G3D10_SERVICE_DISCOVERY` to be the address of the computer running matchmaker (e.g. `HQ-ZZZZZZZ.network.local:6175`)

## Setup SSH Authentication between computers
### SSH setup (remote machine)
1. Install OpenSSH Server (Windows Settings -> System -> Optional Features -> Add a Feature)
2. Start OpenSSH Server [Windows Tutorial](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse?tabs=powershell)
3. Make sure `PubKeyAuthentication yes` is uncommented in `C:ProgramData/ssh/sshd_config`
4. Double check Firewall rules (Allow Apps through Windows Firewall -> Change Settings -> OpenSSH Server)

### SSH setup (local machine)
1. Make sure [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) is installed
2.  Verify WSL can connect to the network while on VPN (if you're not using VPN, you can skip this step). If not
    1. Run PowerShell as Admin. 
    2. For GlobalProtect, run 
        ~~~~~
        Get-NetIPInterface -InterfaceAlias "vEthernet (WSL)" | Set-NetIPInterface -InterfaceMetric 1 >> Get-NetAdapter | Where-Object {$_.InterfaceDescription -like "PANGP*"}| Set-NetIPInterface -InterfaceMetric 6000
        ~~~~~
        see [the discussion thread](https://live.paloaltonetworks.com/t5/globalprotect-discussions/globalprotect-blocks-the-network-traffic-of-wsl2/td-p/354962)
    3. Note: If you get the error:
        ~~~~~
        Get-NetIPInterface : No MSFT_NetIPInterface objects found with property 'InterfaceAlias' equal to 'vEthernet (WSL)'.  Verify the value of the property and retry. 
        ~~~~~
        run `ipconfig` and use the InterfaceAlias with WSL in the name. For a different machine, this was `vEthernet (WSL (Hyper-V firewall))`
        
3.  Make sure your Ubuntu distribution is your default distribution (this was verified with 22.04)
4.  Do the following steps in WSL: 
    1. Create your SSH keys. Do not use RSA, as RSA is not allowed by OpenSSH
    2. Add your keys to ssh-agent 
        ~~~~~
        eval $(ssh-agent -s)
        ssh-add
        ~~~~~
    3.  Send your public key to your remote system. You must already have previous access to the remote machine and be able to authenticate with a password. [Steps adapted from Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_keymanagement)
        
        Note: G3D10_REMOTE_MACHINE is a Windows environment variable and is not available in WSL unless you set it 
        
        a. Run this command if remote user account IS an admin 
            ~~~~~
            # Get the public key file generated previously on your client (replace id_ed25519 if you used another public-key algorithm)
            authorizedKey=$(cat $HOME/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub)
            # Generate the PowerShell to be run remote that will copy the public key file generated previously on your client to the authorized_keys file on your server
            remotePowershell="powershell Add-Content -Force -Path \$env:ProgramData\ssh\administrators_authorized_keys -Value $authorizedKey;icacls.exe \"\$env:ProgramData\ssh\administrators_authorized_keys\" /inheritance:r /grant \"Administrators:F\" /grant \"SYSTEM:F\""
            # Connect to your server and run the PowerShell using the $remotePowerShell variable (G3D10_REMOTE_MACHINE should be a Windows env var, so it doesn't show up in WSL by default)
            ssh account@remoteMachine $remotePowershell
            ~~~~~
        b. Else run this command if remote user account IS NOT an admin 
            ~~~~~
            # Get the public key file generated previously on your client (replace id_ed25519 if you used another public-key algorithm)
            authorizedKey=$(cat $HOME/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub)
            # Generate the PowerShell to be run remote that will copy the public key file generated previously on your client to the authorized_keys file on your server
            remotePowershell="powershell New-Item -Force -ItemType Directory -Path \$env:USERPROFILE\.ssh; Add-Content -Force -Path \$env:USERPROFILE\.ssh\authorized_keys -Value $authorizedKey"
            # Connect to your server and run the PowerShell using the $remotePowerShell variable (G3D10_REMOTE_MACHINE should be a Windows env var, so it doesn't show up in WSL by default)
            ssh account@remoteMachine $remotePowershell
            ~~~~~
    4. Run `wsl ssh $env:G3D10_REMOTE_MACHINE` from Powershell to verify that the setup is correctly
!!! Warning
    If you get asked for a password, you didn't put your public key in the right authorized keys file
            
    - Verify that you followed the correct commands for an admin account vs a non-admin account
            
    - your sshd_config has public key authentication enabled

## Set Up Project In Visual studio
1. Using netchat as the example (prop template), you will have to add project specific flags to the pre/post-build, pre-run steps (Address of the other machine, matchmaking settings, etc.) or else the build will fail. Passing these in is a little less tedious than changing environment variables because that might require restarting Visual studio
2. Pushing F5 will prompt a pre-build script, build and run the project, and prompt a post-build script.
3. In the pre-build step:
    1. Matchmaker will spawn locally
    2. The script will check that the remote machine's environment variable is set to point to matchmaker
    3. Data files will be synced to the specified remote location
4. Once netchat is built and running, it should appear in the matchmaker gui
5. In the post-build script,
    1. Build files are synced to its corresponding remote location
    2. The program binary and its direct dependencies are synced to its corresponding remote location
    3. Here a remote launch should occur but currently this does not work with programs that have GUIs
    4. The program name is recorded in a temporary file used by a cleanup script that can be manually ran to terminate the remote process
